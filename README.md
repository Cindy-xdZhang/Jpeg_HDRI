# Jpeg_HDRI
This repo is an implementation of the paper "Multi-exposure Fusion With JPEG Compression Guidance" on VCIP2018.  

To understand more , there is a supplementary file.  

To run the code,download the repo and in the HDR+.cpp there is a demo.  
ps:  
This code is writen when I was a brandly new programer, so perhaps it can not be robust and handy to transplant to new environment.  
My personal suggestion of your PC environment: Windows10 opencv2.4.9 vs2013.
